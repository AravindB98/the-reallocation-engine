# newgrad-backend-15-1252 — Does this sponsor hire at my level?

## Executive summary

**What this is.** A step-by-step procedure, plus a small tool that runs it, for an international master's student graduating in December 2026 on an F-1 visa who wants a new-graduate backend software job and will need visa sponsorship later. For each job they are considering, it checks public H-1B records and answers a question a job posting does not: *does this company sponsor people at a new-graduate level, or only senior engineers?* It also checks that the posting is still open and that hiring could finish before the student's post-graduation work window runs out. Version 0.2 also reads **what each posting asks for** (years of experience, seniority in the title, role type) and compares it with the student's own level.

**Why read it.** About a third of the sponsors in the engine's dataset with software titles (207 of 571 rows, 36%; reproduce with `census.mjs`) list only senior, staff, lead, or principal-type titles. "This company sponsors" is not the same as "this company sponsors someone like me." Without this check, a new graduate spends hours tailoring applications to companies whose sponsorship history is all senior-level.

**What it found.** On 80 open software-related postings from nine Boston-area company job boards (eight known sponsors plus one company missing from the sponsorship data), the tool marked only 9 for an application (2 to tailor, 7 for a quick application; 7 in total before the persona's experience was corrected from 0 to 1 year). It sent 57 to networking (27 because the posting itself was too senior or off-target, 30 because the company's sponsor list is senior-only) and 14 to research (no sponsorship data).

**What it decides.** Nothing on its own. Each job gets a recommended next step — *tailor an application*, *quick-apply with a referral ask*, *network first*, *skip*, *research by hand*, or *check the posting first* — with every number labeled as a record, a judgment, or the student's own input. The student makes the call at every gate.

## Lifecycle note

The sample path, a live run on 9 real postings, and an 80-posting sweep all run end to end: one command each, real repository data, the existing scorer, both outputs written, nineteen offline tests passing. Proposed addition #6 from v0.1 was built in v0.2 and is closed. Version 0.2.1 fixes errors an outside review found (see the run log 3 entry and FRICTIONAL). The recipe is still **DRAFT**: eight typed TODO items are open (see *Proposed additions*), and the constitution's lifecycle table requires zero open TODOs before SPECIFIED, which comes before RUNNABLE-SAMPLE. Claiming more would claim a gate this recipe has not passed.

## Required reads

| Read | Why |
|---|---|
| `SNICKERDOODLE.md`, `DOMAIN.md` | labels, gates, lifecycle |
| `DATA_CONTRACT.md` §Zero-Conditions | fixtures and logs must not carry personal data |
| `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped-audit.md` | the repo's own coverage count: 1,557 rows (5.1%) with approvals |
| `book/chapters/07-who-sponsors-the-80-days-sponsorship-scorer.md` | tier meanings (Proven / Likely / Unknown / Avoid); the chapter says its thresholds are not yet reconciled |
| `book/chapters/11-the-bayesian-role-scorer.md` | votes vs gates; the 0.9 / 0.6 example probabilities |

## Purpose and source inventory

| What | Path or command | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Sponsorship records | `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-csv/mapped_student_employment_targets_v3.csv` | `Total Approvals`, `Approval_Rate`, `top_job_titles_sponsored`, `median_salary_offered`, `state` |
| National wage | `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv`, row `15-1252.00` | salary sanity check only |
| Census | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/census.mjs` | reproduces the 571 / 207 / 61 counts cited here, offline, with the tool's own title rules |
| Liveness rules | `scripts/ats/liveness-core.mjs` → `classifyLiveness()` | imported, not copied |
| Live page fetch | `scripts/ats/liveness-browser.mjs` → `checkUrlLiveness()` | `--live` only; one URL at a time; only URLs whose host is in `config.json` → `live_hosts` |
| Network hosts (live only) | `job-boards.greenhouse.io`, `boards.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.lever.co`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, and the careers sites Greenhouse redirected to on 2026-10-03: `www.pathai.com`, `www.klaviyo.com`, `careers.toasttab.com`, `careers.formlabs.com` | the only hosts a live run may open; anything else is `host-not-allowed` and never opened |
| Scorer | `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs` | run as a CLI (it has no exports) with `--out-dir`, **without** `--profile` |
| Prototype | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/triage.mjs` | this recipe's runner |
| Sweep (v0.2) | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/sweep.mjs` | the only other network step: one GET per board to `boards-api.greenhouse.io` (named in `config.json` → `sweep.host`); saves postings as snapshots with emails and phone numbers redacted, so triage runs on them offline |
| Person's decisions (v0.2) | `course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/live/human-decisions.json`, `…/runs/sweep/human-decisions-oos.json` | `--human`: the tool reports agreement with decisions the person made by hand |
| Assumptions | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/config.json` | every value `your-input` |
| Persona | `…/fixtures/persona.newgrad.json` | fictional identity, `@example.com`; the author's real dates, 1 year of experience, STEM-eligible MS |

The one command (sample mode, offline). Every command writes to a **new** folder: the tool refuses a folder that already holds a run unless you pass `--overwrite`, so the committed evidence in `runs/sample/`, `runs/live/`, `runs/live-v0.2/` and `runs/sweep/` is never replaced by accident.

```bash
node scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/triage.mjs --today 2026-10-02 --out-dir course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/try-sample-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Live run on real postings, compared with the person's own decisions (v0.2):

```bash
node scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/triage.mjs --roles course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/live/roles.live.json --live --today 2026-10-03 --human course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/live/human-decisions.json --out-dir course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/try-live-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Unfiltered sweep (v0.2): fetch once, then triage offline:

```bash
node scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/sweep.mjs --out-dir course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/try-sweep-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

```

Tests (offline; fictional fixture companies; the real scorer):

```bash
node --test scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/triage.test.mjs
```

## Inputs

**Roles file** (`--roles`): a JSON list, or `{ "roles": [...] }`, of `{ role_id (unique), company, title, url, liveness_snapshot?, apply_date? }`. `liveness_snapshot` is a saved page in `classifyLiveness()` input shape, `{ status, finalUrl, bodyText, applyControls }`, used in sample mode. `apply_date` defaults to `--today`.

**Persona** (`--persona`): `visa.ead_start_date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `visa.unemployment_ceiling` (90 for post-completion OPT; it applies in year 1 even with the STEM extension), `visa.unemployment_days_used`, and (v0.2) `target_role.experience_years` (the author: 1, meaning 1 year full-time plus a 4-month co-op, rounded down; a master's isn't counted as years). A missing field stops the run; it is never defaulted.

**Config** (`config.json`) — all `your-input`, decided by the author on 2026-10-02 (v0.1) and 2026-10-03 (v0.2 keys):

| Key | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `sponsorship.proven_min_approvals` | 10 | the repo audit's median approvals among rows with H-1B data |
| `sponsorship.proven_min_rate` | 90 | a high bar for "it works"; Ch.7 describes Proven as high approval |
| `sponsorship.p_proven` / `p_likely` | 0.9 / 0.6 | the probabilities Ch.11's worked example uses for those tiers |
| `timeline.hiring_lag_days` | 45 | middle estimate for a multi-round new-grad loop (screen, assessment, onsite, offer, paperwork) |
| `timeline.buffer_days` | 30 | a month of margin before the unemployment limit counts as fully safe |
| `target_soc` | 15-1252 | BLS Software Developers |
| `live_hosts` | the hosts listed in the source inventory | names every host a live run may open (assignment rule: no unnamed hosts) |
| `requirements.close_gap_years` | 3 | the author's own G5 rule from the live run: a posting asking up to 3 years more than mine, or a "II" title, is *close* (quick apply); more is *far* (network) |
| `requirements.off_target_title_terms` | android, ios, mobile, embedded, firmware, frontend, front-end, hardware, sdet, designer | roles outside a backend stack (the Toast Android case) |
| `timeline.lag_scenarios` | 30, 45, 60 | sensitivity only; 45 still feeds the score |
| `sweep.boards` / `sweep.filter` | 9 Greenhouse boards; software titles in US locations; interns, designers, PMs, recruiters and sales excluded; **seniority not pre-filtered** | an unfiltered test set, so the tool's own rule does the filtering |

## Phase gates

Run variables used below: `OUT=course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/sample`. All tests read files that the run writes; none read `data/raw/`, `data/verified/`, or `logs/gate-decisions/`, which do not exist. Human clearances are recorded in the run's `logs/runs/2026fa-ashwinthankachan26-<n>.md` entry with name and date.

| Gate | Kind | Testable condition | What the human must see to clear it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1 Input** | machine, hard stop | `triage.mjs` exits 0 and `$OUT/triage-log.json` parses with ≥ 1 role. Bad JSON, duplicate `role_id`, missing persona `visa.*` field, or a bad date → exit 2, nothing written. | the role count echoed by the run |
| **G2 Sponsorship evidence** | human | every role sent to the scorer has `csv_match.status == "found"` and `sponsorship.status == "scored"` (command below) | for each scored role: the posting's company vs the matched CSV `company_name` and `state`. A wrong match is rejected by moving the role to RESEARCH. |
| **G3 Liveness** | **gate (multiplier)** | every entry in `$OUT/roles.for-scorer.json` has a numeric `liveness.factor` (1 or 0); `uncertain` / not checked never reach the scorer | the URL, result code, and reason for every TAILOR / NETWORK row. In sample mode the source is `your-input` (a snapshot), so the posting must be checked live before acting. |
| **G4 Timeline** | **gate (multiplier)** | every role has `timeline.factor` in [0, 1] and `timeline.slack_days` | the EAD start date, last unemployment day, hiring lag, and slack. The student confirms the dates are still their best estimate. |
| **G5 Decision** | human | `$OUT/triage-report.md` exists and opens with `## Executive summary` | the report, including the **quoted experience line** from each posting (v0.2), which the person checks against the posting. The student writes their own tailor / quick-apply / network / skip choice per row in the run-log entry; with `--human`, the report shows where the tool and the person disagree. The tool never applies or sends anything. |

Gate commands:

```bash
OUT=course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/sample
# G2 — machine half, then the rows a human must eyeball
node -e "const l=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.argv[1]+'/triage-log.json','utf8')); const s=l.roles.filter(r=>r.scorer); const bad=s.filter(r=>r.csv_match.status!=='found'||r.sponsorship.status!=='scored'); s.forEach(r=>console.log(r.company,'→',r.csv_match.company_name.value,r.csv_match.state.value)); process.exit(bad.length?1:0)" "$OUT"
# G3 — the scorer only received explicit 1/0 liveness factors
node -e "const r=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.argv[1]+'/roles.for-scorer.json','utf8')); process.exit(r.every(x=>x.liveness.factor===1||x.liveness.factor===0)?0:1)" "$OUT"
# G4 — every role carries a bounded timeline factor and its slack
node -e "const l=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.argv[1]+'/triage-log.json','utf8')); process.exit(l.roles.every(r=>r.timeline.factor>=0&&r.timeline.factor<=1&&Number.isInteger(r.timeline.slack_days))?0:1)" "$OUT"
# G5 — the human report exists and leads with a summary
head -3 "$OUT/triage-report.md"
```

## Workflow

| # | Step | Labor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Write the roles file: company, title, URL per role (sample: snapshots; live: real URLs on allowed hosts) | human |
| 2 | Run the one command; G1 checks inputs | agent |
| 3 | Exact normalized-name lookup in the CSV (legal suffixes dropped; never fuzzy). No row, two or more rows, no approvals, or no software title listed → RESEARCH | agent |
| 4 | Sponsorship tier from approvals and rate using `config.json` thresholds; probability from the tier | agent (rule) |
| 5 | Level fit from the sponsored-title list: *non-senior title present*, *senior-only on list*, or *no software title listed* | agent (rule) |
| 6 | Liveness via `classifyLiveness()` on the snapshot or the live page; `uncertain` / not checked → CHECK-LIVENESS | agent |
| 7 | Timeline factor from persona dates, hiring lag, and buffer | agent |
| 8 | Write `roles.for-scorer.json` (sponsorship, liveness, timeline; **no** fit) and run the existing scorer | agent |
| 9 | (v0.2) Read the posting text already loaded (live page, snapshot, or board API): first "N years … experience" phrase, the title's level word (Senior/Staff/Lead/… = far, II = close, III+ = far), and role type; count mismatches against the persona | agent (rule on a record) |
| 10 | Map the scorer's recommendation + level fit + mismatches to a next action: 0 → TAILOR, 1 → QUICK-APPLY, 2+ → NETWORK; senior-only sponsor list → NETWORK; Skip → SKIP | agent (rule) |
| 11 | Report the 30/45/60-day lag table and the apply-by dates | agent |
| 12 | Clear G2–G5 and record the decisions; optionally compare with `--human` | human |

Timeline arithmetic: last unemployment day = EAD start + (ceiling − days used) − 1; earliest start = later of EAD start and apply date + hiring lag; slack = last day − earliest start; factor = 1 if slack ≥ buffer, slack ÷ buffer if 0 ≤ slack < buffer, 0 if slack < 0. For the author's plan (EAD 2027-02-01, 90 days, none used): last day 2027-05-01. Applying today lands on the EAD date with 89 days of slack (factor 1); applying on 2027-04-10 gives slack −24 (factor 0). To keep the full 30-day buffer, apply by 2027-03-02 (30-day lag), 2027-02-15 (45), or 2027-01-31 (60).

## What it can verify

- That a company name matches **exactly one** CSV row after normalization, and which row (name and state shown for G2).
- The `Total Approvals`, `Approval_Rate`, `median_salary_offered`, and sponsored titles in that row, copied without change (`record`). Hand-checked for Acquia on 2026-10-02: 18 approvals, 100.0%, 165000.16, Staff + Senior Software Engineer — all match the report.
- Whether every sponsored **software** title on that row's list is senior-level, under a stated regex.
- What the repository's liveness classifier concludes about a page: live in `--live` mode (`record`), from a saved snapshot otherwise (`your-input`).
- The timeline arithmetic, given the student's dates and assumptions.
- That the scorer received only roles with complete evidence and an explicit liveness factor (tested).
- (v0.2) The posting's own experience sentence, quoted exactly. The **quote** is `record` when read live or from the board API (a board-API snapshot saved by `sweep.mjs` stays `record`, since it's the board's own text at `fetched_at`; a hand-written sample snapshot is `your-input`). The **number** taken from it, the title level and the off-target class are `model-judgment` (labels corrected in v0.2.1; the saved v0.2 outputs still carry the old labels). Correct on every live posting that states years (Vestmark 2–4, Cohere 2+, Lendbuzz 3+, Formlabs 4+, Klaviyo 5+, Toast 3+).
- (v0.2) How often the tool agrees with the person's own decisions: **7 of 8** on the live run (in-sample: the rule was written from those decisions) and **3 of 6** on six sweep postings I judged blind, before seeing the tool's answer. The sweep pool isn't fully unseen: 7 of my 9 live postings are in it, and a dry run on it led to one fix before the official run. So this is a small blind agreement check, not a clean held-out test.

## What it cannot verify

- **Whether the company will sponsor this role.** Approvals are counted company-wide, not per role.
- **Which years the approvals cover.** The CSV and its audit do not say. A strong count may describe a different era.
- **Titles beyond the top few.** The CSV keeps only a company's top sponsored titles. "Senior-only" means senior-only *on that list*. Example: Toast has 150 approvals, but its listed software titles are Senior and Staff — the list cannot show whether new graduates were sponsored.
- **Anything about the ~95% of CSV rows with no approval data.** They are unknown, not non-sponsors, and are routed to a person.
- **Fit between the student and the job.** The fit vote is not computed, so the composite tops out at 0.35 × 0.9 = 0.315.
- **Recent funding.** CSV funding dates end at 2025-09-26; only 15 of the 200 shipped Form D sample rows (14 companies) match a CSV company by name (reproduce with `census.mjs`). That's too thin to use as a funding signal.
- **Boston pay.** The salary check is national and company-wide.
- **Whether a live page is honest.** The classifier reads the page; a posting left up after the role was filled can still look live.
- **Every way a posting states experience.** v0.2 needs the word "experience" near the number. "12+ years in the software development lifecycle" (Cohere, Staff) was missed; only the title's "Staff" caught it. "BS + 3 years or MS + 1 year" equivalences aren't read. (v0.1 read no posting text at all; in the v0.1 live run, 4 of 5 TAILOR roles asked for 2–5+ years.)
- **The difference between "far" and "way too far".** The person skips roles 8–12+ years above them; the tool sends every far role to NETWORK (2 of the 3 out-of-sample disagreements).
- **Role type beyond a title word list.** "Off-target" is a list of title words (Android, embedded, …). A backend posting with an unusual title, or a mobile role without those words, isn't caught.
- **E-Verify enrollment.** The STEM OPT extension needs an E-Verify employer; nothing in the repo shows which companies are enrolled.
- **Every network request a live page makes.** The allowlist controls which page is opened. Redirect targets are named but not re-checked by code, and pages load their own scripts and assets.
- **Titles the regex doesn't recognize as software.** "Full Stack Engineer" has no software/backend/developer word, so it is not counted (found on Lendbuzz's row, 2026-10-03).

## Facts that bite — how each is handled

| Fact | Handling |
|---|---|
| Role quality has weight 0.0 in the scorer | Salary is reported **beside** the score (ratio to the BLS median), never fed into it. No weight is proposed. |
| `bls:local-wage` feeds nothing | Not used. Boston-adjusted pay is proposed addition #4. |
| Only SEC samples ship | Funding is not a vote here: only 15 of the 200 shipped Form D sample rows (14 companies) match a CSV company by name (reproduce with `census.mjs`), and CSV funding dates end 2025-09-26. (v0.1 said "0 of 200"; that came from a buggy check and was corrected in v0.2.1.) |
| Some directories named in recipes don't exist | Gates read `--out-dir` files and log to `logs/runs/`, both of which exist. |
| The `snickerdoodle` CLI is roadmap | Not used. Everything runs with `node`. |
| "Every top-level recipe is DRAFT" (Canvas wording) | On this commit, `npm run doctor` actually reports 28 DRAFT, 4 RUNNABLE-SAMPLE and 1 RUNNABLE-LIVE top-level recipes. This one is DRAFT, for the reason in the lifecycle note. |
| `npm run bls:local-wage` fails on a fresh clone | Not called. |
| `validate-h1b-join-sample.py` needs full data | Not called. Only the shipped CSV is used. |
| *(found in this work)* The scorer reads "authorized" as "no sponsorship needed" | The scorer is called without `--profile`. Reported upstream as proposed addition #5. |
| *(found in this work)* A missing `liveness` field defaults to 1.0 in the scorer | The prototype always writes the field and never sends an unchecked role. |
| *(found in this work)* `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` (Canvas "Before you start") fails on a fresh clone: `Error: portals.yml not found. Run onboarding first.` (`data/ats/portals.yml` is gitignored; only `portals.example.yml` ships) | Not used. Liveness goes through `liveness-core.mjs` / `liveness-browser.mjs` directly, and candidate postings come from a roles file or `sweep.mjs`. |

## Proposed additions

| # | Addition | Why it belongs | Marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A bounded fit vote: résumé vs posting, labeled `model-judgment`, computed after the record checks | The scorer reserves weight 0.30 for it; without it, Likely sponsors can never reach Apply | `[TODO: DEV]` |
| 2 | Fiscal-year coverage for `Total Approvals` | Turns "has sponsored" into "has sponsored recently" | `[TODO: DATA SOURCE]` |
| 3 | A full per-title sponsorship list (DOL LCA disclosure: job title and SOC per filing) in place of the truncated top-titles list | Removes the main false-NETWORK risk (the Toast case) | `[TODO: DATA SOURCE]` |
| 4 | Boston-adjusted wage via `scripts/bls/local-wage-adjustment.py`, once its `.venv` and `requirements.txt` ship | National medians overstate or understate local offers | `[TODO: DEV]` |
| 5 | Fix the scorer's authorization regex so "work authorized (EAD)" still needs sponsorship | A maintained file outside the student namespace; a maintainer decision | `[TODO: APPROVE]` |
| 6 | ~~A posting-requirements gate~~ **built in v0.2** (`postingRequirements`, `titleLevel`, `mismatchCount` in `lib.mjs`; 5 tests). Closed: script exists, conformance passes, live + sweep runs logged | The v0.1 live run's biggest miss | closed |
| 7 | A "too far → SKIP" tier for postings far above the persona's level (the out-of-sample check: I skipped a 12+ year Staff role the tool sent to NETWORK, and an 8+ year Staff role at a company with no sponsorship data that the tool sent to RESEARCH). The threshold is a human decision; it must be set before seeing results, not tuned to these 6 | 2 of the 3 out-of-sample disagreements were roles I'd skip as far too senior (one went to NETWORK, one to RESEARCH) | `[TODO: DEV]` |
| 8 | Broaden the years reader: "N+ years in/with …" without the word "experience", and "or MS + N years" equivalences | the missed Cohere "12+ years in the SDLC" | `[TODO: DEV]` |
| 9 | An E-Verify enrollment source for the STEM OPT extension (e.g. the public E-Verify employer search, downloaded and verified first) | a STEM-eligible student can't use the extension at a non-E-Verify employer | `[TODO: DATA SOURCE]` |

## Output contract

Both files are written to `--out-dir` (default `course/2026fa/submissions/ashwinthankachan26/runs/<date>/`). Writing under `data/` is refused.

**For the agent — `triage-log.json`:** `_recipe`, `recipe_version`, `run_date`, `mode`, `inputs` (paths), `assumptions` (all `your-input`), `scorer_stdout`, `counts` per action, `gaps`, `gates` (G1–G5 with status), (v0.2) `apply_by`, `human_agreement`, and `roles[]`. Each role has `csv_match`, `sponsorship` (each value `{ value, source, field | basis }`), `level_fit`, `salary`, `liveness`, `timeline`, (v0.2) `lag_sensitivity`, `posting_requirements` (`years { value, source: model-judgment, quote, quote_source }`, `role_type`, `title_level { value, source: model-judgment, title_source }`), `mismatch { value, parts }`, `blockers`, `scorer` (composite, recommendation, reason, arithmetic) when scored, and `next_action { action, why, source }`.

**For the person — `triage-report.md`:** Executive summary → Results table (next action, why, sponsorship, level fit, **posting asks**, liveness, timeline, composite) → (v0.2) Does the tool agree with my own decisions? → Hiring-lag sensitivity → Verified vs inferred → Salary sanity check → Gates for you to clear (checkboxes) → What this run cannot tell you → Run record.

Also kept for audit: `roles.for-scorer.json`, plus the scorer's own `role-scores.json` and `role-scores.md`, unchanged.

## Stop conditions

Stop, and do not invent a value, when:

- G1 fails — exit 2 with the reason; nothing is written.
- A company has no row, several rows, or no approvals — RESEARCH. Never fuzzy-match, never set sponsorship to 0.
- Liveness is `uncertain` or not checked — CHECK-LIVENESS. Never default to 1.0.
- A live URL's host is not on the allowlist — not checked; the page is not opened.
- Asked to pass `--profile` — the tool refuses (exit 2), because of the scorer's authorization trap.
- `--out-dir` already holds a run — refused (exit 2) unless `--overwrite` is passed on purpose.
- An impossible calendar date (e.g. 2027-02-30) — refused (exit 2), never rolled forward.
- A closed posting or an impossible timeline — SKIP, even when the company is also missing from the data.
- Asked to change thresholds in `config.json` after seeing which roles pass — refuse in the same run; record a new decision with a date and reason first.
- Asked to apply, email, or contact anyone — out of scope; the tool ends at the report.

## Next action per result — and where it goes in the 3-3-2 day

| Result | Next action | Time block |
|---|---|---|
| Scorer Apply/Consider, non-senior titles on the sponsor list, posting asks nothing above my level | **TAILOR**: write the tailored application (check the quoted experience line first) | the 2 research-and-apply hours |
| Same, but one mismatch (asks ≤ 3 years more than mine, a "II" title, or an off-target role) | **QUICK-APPLY**: send the template résumé and ask a contact for a referral; don't spend tailoring hours | ~15 min of the 2 hours, plus a networking message |
| Same, but the posting is far (asks 4+ years more, a Senior/Staff/Lead title, or two mismatches) | **NETWORK**: ask about junior roles at the company instead | the 3 networking hours |
| Scorer Apply/Consider but every listed software title is senior | **NETWORK** — ask a contact or alum whether the team sponsors new graduates before tailoring | the 3 networking hours |
| Scorer Skip (closed posting, impossible timeline, low composite) | **SKIP** — time returned | — |
| No row, ambiguous row, no approvals, no software title | **RESEARCH** — check the company's own sponsorship statement or ask a recruiter | 15 minutes, human |
| Posting not checked or classifier unsure | **CHECK-LIVENESS** — open it, or rerun with `--live` | 2 minutes, human |

## Verification checks

- Offline tests: `node --test scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252/triage.test.mjs` — 19 tests: every route, the real scorer, a refused bad input; v0.2.1 adds refusals (impossible dates, `--profile`, an existing run folder), closed-posting precedence, corrected labels and the SEC match count; v0.2 adds requirement phrases copied from the live postings, the mismatch rule, the title-level fix, lag sensitivity, and sweep redaction.
- Out-of-sample (v0.2): 6 sweep postings drawn by seed, judged by the person before seeing the tool's answer, compared with `--human`. Report the number; don't change the rule to fit it.
- Conformance: `node scripts/conformance.mjs recipes/cases/2026fa scripts/contrib/2026fa/ashwinthankachan26-newgrad-backend-15-1252`.
- Hand-check one row against the CSV with a quote-aware reader (`python3` `csv.DictReader`). `cut -d,` splits inside the quoted titles field and drops columns.
- **Break A:** change `livenessGate(null)` to return `cleared: true, factor: 1`. Expected: the liveness unit test and the end-to-end test fail. Then `git restore` the file.
- **Break B:** run the scorer with `{"authorization":"F-1 STEM OPT — work authorized (EAD)"}` as `--profile`. Expected: `profile_needs_sponsorship: false`, and the Proven sponsor drops from Apply (0.4462) to Skip (0.1785).
