# TEST-REPORT — network-targets-swe

## Executive summary

This report records how the network-targets prototype was tested.

- **Repo checks:** the repository's own checks pass before and after my changes, with
  identical results.
- **Tests:** the prototype's seven offline tests pass.
- **Failure cases:** each one I named fails clearly without inventing a value.
- **Scope:** my branch adds files only inside my own namespaces.

What still needs a human: reading the generated report before acting on it (gate H1), and
section 5 below, the clean-checkout re-run, which I do myself before submitting.

## 1. Toolchain baseline — before and after

**Before** = `main` at `015843d`, checked out in a separate temporary worktree.
**After** = my branch at `b8ebccb`. Node v22.11.0, Python 3.11.5.

Notes:
- **Doctor doesn't see my recipe.** Doctor's recipe dashboard counts only top-level
  `recipes/*.md`, so my recipe in `recipes/cases/2026fa/` (DRAFT, 3 TODOs) doesn't change
  its numbers.
- **Manifest warnings are pre-existing, and W2 is a false positive.** The three warnings
  appear on `main` too.
  - W2 says `private/` and `data/ats/` are not gitignored.
  - `git check-ignore -v private/x.md data/ats/pipeline.md` shows both are ignored via
    `/private/*` and `/data/ats/*` (`.gitignore` lines 37 and 40).

`npm run verify` on the branch:

```
$ npm run verify
MANIFEST CHECK — The Reallocation Engine
==========================================

WARN (3):
  W1 ignore path not in .gitignore: archive/
  W2 private path not gitignored (PII/secret risk): private/
  W2 private path not gitignored (PII/secret risk): data/ats/

✓ manifest check passed (3 warnings)
```

Conformance on my paths:

```
$ node scripts/conformance.mjs scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/ recipes/cases/2026fa/ course/2026fa/submissions/lavanyarajesh24/
conformance: 26 files (7 md · 4 js · 15 json)
✓ all conform (machine half of P4). Adequacy is still the human gate.
```

## 2. The sample run

```
$ node scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/network-targets.mjs --today 2026-10-02
✓ network-targets 2026-10-02: 133 candidates from 30369 CSV rows
  apply 8 · network 5 · check-board 120 · skip 0 · not-in-dataset 0
  scorer: scored 22 roles → Apply 15 · Consider 2 · Skip 5 (skip 23%)
  Form D sample match: 0/133 (200 sample filings)
  course/2026fa/submissions/lavanyarajesh24/runs/network-targets-log.json  +  course/2026fa/submissions/lavanyarajesh24/runs/network-targets-report.md
exit=0
```

Full outputs are in `runs/`. The first run, before the location/seniority fix, is kept in
`runs/first-pass/`.

## 3. Offline test suite

```
$ node --test scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/network-targets.test.mjs
ok 1 - full fixture run routes every fictional company to the bucket it was built for
ok 2 - unchecked companies are never sent to the scorer, and the real scorer gated the no-posting ones
ok 3 - every emitted value carries one of the three source labels
ok 4 - break attempt: an OPT window that already ended halts the run with no decisions
ok 5 - break attempt: a CSV missing a required column fails clearly instead of guessing
ok 6 - single-file snapshot bundle gives the same routing; a corrupted bundle leaves everyone unchecked
ok 7 - refuses to write outside its own namespace inside the repo
# tests 7
# pass 7
# fail 0
```

How the tests stay honest:
- The fixtures are nine fictional companies, each built for one case.
- The tests run the real prototype as a subprocess, which runs the real
  `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs`. Test 2 asserts the score file's `_scorer` field is
  the maintained scorer's.
- No network: board snapshots are files, and the corrupted one is generated at runtime.
- **Mutation check.** I temporarily reverted the location match to substring matching:

  ```
  not ok 1 - full fixture run routes every fictional company to the bucket it was built for
      +     'Manitoba, Canada'
  # pass 5
  # fail 1
  ```

  Restoring the fix → `# pass 7`, `# fail 0`.

## 4. Each named failure case, exercised

| CHANGE-BRIEF case | How exercised | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Company missing from the CSV | fixture persona names `ZULU NOT REAL INC` | bucket `not-in-dataset`; no approval count is shown for it (test 1) |
| 2. OPT window already past | real CLI with `fixtures/persona.past-opt.fixture.json` | output below; also test 4 |
| 3. Board missing / 404 / bad JSON | fixtures: Echo (saved 404), Delta (corrupted file), corrupted bundle; **and real**: 7 slugs returned 404 | all → `check-board` with reason `board-error` / `snapshot-unparseable` / `no-snapshot`; none sent to the scorer (tests 1, 2, 6; real run) |
| 4. Missing funding date | fixture Charlie has an empty `latest_funding_date` | recency `unknown`, network priority B, `latest_date: null` (test 1) |
| 5. Form D join finds nothing | real run | `Form D sample match: 0/133 (200 sample filings)`; the fixture proves the join works when a match exists (1/6, test 1) |
| (extra) CSV missing a column | test 5 renames `Total Approvals` | exit 2, `G1 csv-columns-missing … Total Approvals` |
| (extra) Overwriting a tracked repo file | real CLI | output below; also test 7 |

```
$ node scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/network-targets.mjs --persona scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/fixtures/persona.past-opt.fixture.json --out-dir /tmp/nt-break --today 2026-10-02

exit=3

$ node scripts/contrib/2026fa/lavanyarajesh24-network-targets-swe/network-targets.mjs --out-dir data/examples
✗ G0 unsafe-out-dir: --out-dir data/examples is inside the repo but outside this student's namespace; refusing to write
  nothing decided.
exit=2
```

## 5. Clean-checkout run (run by me, 2026-10-03)

I ran this myself from a fresh clone of my fork's branch, at commit `104e047`. That was the
branch head at the time, before this section and my own edits to the write-ups were added.
No `npm install` was needed. The output below is pasted unedited from my terminal.

```

**Result:** identical to the run in my working copy. 133 candidates → apply 8 · network 5 ·
check-board 120; Form D 0/133. All 7 tests pass on a fresh clone.

## 6. Privacy scan

```
$ node scripts/pii-scan.mjs --diff main
pii-scan: clean ✓

$ node scripts/pii-scan.mjs
pii-scan: 1 finding(s) — see DATA_CONTRACT.md §Zero-Conditions

  [email] package-lock.json — <an npm package author's address; redacted here so this report does not repeat it>
```

- The branch-history scan, which is what CI runs on a PR, is clean.
- The one working-tree finding is **pre-existing on `main`**. `package-lock.json` is
  unchanged by my branch (`git diff --quiet main -- package-lock.json` succeeds) and was
  last touched in upstream commit `d08afdd`.
- `npm install` modifies `package-lock.json` locally. I reverted it before committing.

## 7. Scope — `git diff --stat main...HEAD`

Final file list, as of commit `27c305f`, the commit just before this section was updated. Only the line count of this file changes afterwards.

- **Large line counts are data, not code.** The two run logs and the board snapshot
  account for most of the inserted lines.

## 8. What the gate requires a human to judge (H1)

The prototype stops at a report. Before acting on any row, a person must:

- **Apply now:** open each listed posting and confirm it is still open and can start on or
  after 2027-01-15. Then rate fit, which the tool does not do.
- **Network first:**
  - check the company's own careers page, since a second board may exist (e.g. Cambridge
    Mobile Telematics' Greenhouse board lists only internships);
  - decide whom to contact;
  - remember that "Proven" counts have no dates.
- **Check the board first:** find the real board or ATS before concluding anything.
